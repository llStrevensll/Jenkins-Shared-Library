Jenkins Shared Library

Jenkins Shared Libraries are written in Groovy and allow you to create common sets of logic, and share that among teams/projects/organizations. Instead of “copy and pasting” the code from some other Jenkinsfile, you can simply load a library in to Jenkins and every pipeline job on that Jenkins master has access to that shared library.
